# first year c programing repo

this readme file will also function as a log till i find a better substitute in Github!

 This repository consists of the programs i created during my first year of learning C programming
 this is also my first time using github to publish programs, i'll use this oportunity to learn github better

 programs in this repo ae mostly very basic/bigginer programs.

 30/09/2022: published the repo for the first time with some basic programs like dice, calculator, adding and merging two arrays, generating random numbers and storing them in an array and reversing an array etc
 
 02/10/2022: added an include file and a program to find the greatest number from the user given numbers. also set up a greetings automation (not sure how that will work though haha)
