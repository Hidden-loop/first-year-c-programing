# first year c programing repo

this readme file will also function as a log till i find a better substitute in Github!

 This repository consists of the programs i created during my first year of learning C programming.
 This is also my first time using github to publish programs, i'll use this oportunity to learn github better.

 programs in this repo ae mostly very basic/beginner programs.

 30/09/2022: published the repo for the first time with some basic programs like dice, calculator, adding and merging two arrays, generating random numbers and storing them in an array and reversing an array etc.
 
 02/10/2022: added an include file and a program to find the greatest number from the user given numbers. also set up a greetings automation (not sure how that will work though haha).

03/10/2022: added Bubble Sort Algorithm program.

05/10/2022: addded program to find address of a variable.

07/10/2022: added programs for addition and multiplication in 2D arrays using matrixs.

08/10/2022: added program to reverse inputted number.

17/10/2022: added programs to show use of functions and program to print a pattern.

4/11/2022: added programs like stack, factorial finding program and array filling program; all of which show use of user defined functions.

10/11/2022: added program to show string operations.

25/11/2022: added programs to print different patterns and to show how to input and output datatypes.

8/12/2022: added proogram to convert temperatures in celsius to fahrenheit and kelvin.

11/12/2022: added programs to show use of count sort algorithm and binary sort algorithms (using both iterative and recursive methods).

18/12/2022: added programs to demonstrate simple linked list, merge 2 arrays into a sorted array, guess the type of triangle,patterns.

21/12/2022: added program to check collinearity of 3 dots, to find y from slope and to find factorial upto a given number.

5/02/2023: added program for restaurant billing system.
